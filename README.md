# RBD
Recognizing Blurred Documents (RBD) with Deep Learning created by me.
This model is a convolutional autoencoder network created by Keras from the TensorFlow Library in Python.
You can see some examples recognized by the model below.
This model is trained by 3 levels and The special advantage of this model is that it can recognize images with different dimensions. The way this model works is that it takes images of any size and converts them into 64x64 pieces and recognizes them, and finally sticks these pieces together and displays the final image.
